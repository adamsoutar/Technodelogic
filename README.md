# Tech-node-logic

*Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail, upgrade it*

## What is this project?

An Esoteric Language is one created for fun, a joke or an experiment rather than
productivity.

[Technlogic](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Technologic) is an EsoLang created by
Cemetech user [JWinslow23](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14998&start=0)
in 2018. Every program is designed to look like the lyrics to
[Daft Punk's Technologic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8K90hX4PrE).

Tech-node-logic is an interpreter written in NodeJS for Technologic and, to my knowledge, the world's
first & only implementation of the language.

## Use it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamsoutar/technodelogic
cd technodelogic/src
# Just a suggested file extension, any works
node index.js myCode.tl
```

##Â Implementation features

Tech-node-logic supports **every** feature of Technologic. Including, but not
limited to:

 - Functions + recursion
 - Scope
 - Unary operators
 - The stack
 - Loops + control structures

## What does Technologic code look like?
